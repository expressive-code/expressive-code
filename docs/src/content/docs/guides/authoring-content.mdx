After you've added Expressive Code to your site, it will automatically render all code blocks in your markdown / MDX documents. You now have access to a range of features described below.

## Default features

### Syntax highlighting using Shiki

To enable syntax highlighting, ensure that your code blocks are wrapped in code fences (using three or more backticks), and that your opening code fences have a language identifier, e.g. `js` for JavaScript:

````md
```js
console.log('This code will be syntax highlighted!')
```
````

### Text markers

To add text markers to your code, you can add instructions to the **meta information** of your code blocks. This is the string following the language identifier of your opening code fence. The following features are available:

- [Marking entire lines & line ranges](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/main/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-text-markers/README.md#marking-entire-lines--line-ranges)
- [Marking individual text inside lines](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/main/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-text-markers/README.md#marking-entire-lines--line-ranges)
  - Plaintext search strings
  - Regular expressions
- [Using multiple marker types (`mark`, `ins`, `del`)](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/main/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-text-markers/README.md#selecting-marker-types-mark-ins-del)

### Window frames

Window frames can be rendered around every code block. Depending on the code's language identifier, this frame can look like a code editor (similar to VS Code), or like a terminal window.

Frames can have optional titles, which are either taken from the code block's meta string, or from a file name comment in the first lines of the code.

- [Code editor window frames](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/main/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-frames/README.md#code-editor-window-frames)
- [Terminal window frames](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/main/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-frames/README.md#terminal-window-frames)
- [Adding titles (open file tab or terminal window title)](https://github.com/expressive-code/expressive-code/blob/main/packages/%40expressive-code/plugin-frames/README.md#adding-titles-open-file-tab-or-terminal-window-title)

### Example of everything combined

````md
# Markdown example

The following code block will be highlighted as JavaScript,
wrapped in a code editor frame with the file name "example.js",
and the line range 2-4 will be marked:

```js title="example.js" {2-4}
// Example function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b
}

console.log(add(1, 2))
```
````
