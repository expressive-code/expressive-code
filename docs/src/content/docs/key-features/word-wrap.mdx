When your code blocks contain long lines, it can be helpful to enable word wrap to keep the code within the bounds of the container and avoid the need for horizontal scrolling.

## Usage in markdown / MDX

### Configuring word wrap per block

You can enable or disable word wrap on individual code blocks using the `wrap` boolean prop in the **meta information** of your code blocks. This is done by appending `wrap` or `wrap=true` to your opening code fence to enable word wrapping, or `wrap=false` to disable it:

````md ins=/(?\<=&#96;.*)wrap\S*/
```js wrap
// Example with wrap
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

```js wrap=false
// Example with wrap=false
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```
````

The above code will be rendered like this:

```js wrap
// Example with wrap
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

```js wrap=false
// Example with wrap=false
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

:::note
Manually adding the `wrap` prop as shown above is useful if you only want to change the behavior of a few code blocks on your site. If you want to affect all code blocks, you can do so in the [configuration](#configuration) instead.

### Configuring indentation of wrapped lines

By default, wrapped parts of long lines will be aligned with their line's indentation level, making the wrapped code appear to start at the same column. This increases readability of the wrapped code and can be especially useful for languages where indentation is significant, e.g. Python.

You can also disable this behavior so that wrapped parts of long lines will always start at column 1. This can be useful to reproduce terminal output.

To change this behavior for a code block, you can use the `preserveIndent` boolean prop in the **meta information** of your code blocks:

````md ins=/(?\<=&#96;.*)preserveIndent\S*/
```js wrap preserveIndent
// Example with preserveIndent (enabled by default)
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

```js wrap preserveIndent=false
// Example with preserveIndent=false
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```
````

The above code will be rendered like this:

```js wrap preserveIndent
// Example with preserveIndent (enabled by default)
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

```js wrap preserveIndent=false
// Example with preserveIndent=false
function getLongString() {
  return 'This is a very long string that will most probably not fit into the available space unless the container is extremely wide'
}
```

## Usage in the `<Code>` component

The following props are available on the `<Code>` component to configure word wrap behavior:

### Props

#### wrap

<PropertySignature>
- Type: `boolean`
- Default: ``false``
</PropertySignature>

If `true`, word wrapping will be enabled for the code block, causing lines that exceed the available width to wrap to the next line. You can use the `preserveIndent` option to control how wrapped lines are indented.

If `false`, lines that exceed the available width will cause a horizontal scrollbar to appear.

:::note
This option only affects how the code block is displayed and does not change the actual code. When copied to the clipboard, the code will still contain the original unwrapped lines.
:::

#### preserveIndent

<PropertySignature>
- Type: `boolean`
- Default: ``true``
</PropertySignature>

If `true`, wrapped parts of long lines will be aligned with their line's indentation level, making the wrapped code appear to start at the same column. This increases readability of the wrapped code and can be especially useful for languages where indentation is significant, e.g. Python.

If `false`, wrapped parts of long lines will always start at column 1. This can be useful to reproduce terminal output.

:::note
This option only has an effect if `wrap` is `true`. It only affects how the code block is displayed and does not change the actual code. When copied to the clipboard, the code will still contain the original unwrapped lines.

## Configuration

You can configure the default word wrap settings using the `defaultProps` option in your Expressive Code configuration. You can also change the defaults by language using the sub-property `overridesByLang`:

<ConfigVariants
  settings={`
    defaultProps: {
      // Enable word wrap by default
      wrap: true,
      // Disable wrapped line indentation for terminal languages
      overridesByLang: {
        'bash,ps,sh': { preserveIndent: false },
      },
    },
  `}
/>
