If you are already using Expressive Code and want to upgrade to a newer version, this page will guide you through the process.

## Breaking changes in v0.27.0

### Config option `theme` has been renamed to `themes`

Efficient multi-theme support using CSS variables is now a core feature, so the `theme` option was deprecated in favor of the new array `themes`.

Please migrate your existing config to use `themes` and ensure it is an array. If you only need a single theme, your `themes` array can contain just this one theme. However, please consider the benefits of providing multiple themes. See the [`themes`](#themes) option for more details.

```diff lang="js"
  /** @type {import('remark-expressive-code').RemarkExpressiveCodeOptions} */
  const remarkExpressiveCodeOptions = {
-   theme: 'dracula',
+   // Rename to `themes` and ensure it is an array
+   // (also consider adding a light theme for accessibility)
+   themes: ['dracula'],
  },
```

### Config option `styleOverrides` now contains all plugin styles in nested objects

In previous versions, there could be multiple `styleOverrides` scattered through the configuration (one per plugin with configurable style settings). This has been simplified to a single top-level `styleOverrides` object that contains all style overrides.

Plugins can contribute their own style settings to this object as well by nesting them inside under their plugin name.

```diff lang="js"
  /** @type {import('remark-expressive-code').RemarkExpressiveCodeOptions} */
  const remarkExpressiveCodeOptions = {
    frames: {
      showCopyToClipboardButton: false,
-     styleOverrides: {
-       shadowColor: '#124',
-     },
    },
+   styleOverrides: {
+     frames: {
+       shadowColor: '#124',
+     },
+     // You could override other plugin styles here as well:
+     // textMarkers: { ... },
+   },
  },
```

### Config option `textMarkers` can no longer be an object

In previous versions, the `textMarkers` config option could be an object containing plugin options. This is no longer supported, as the only option that was available (`styleOverrides`) has been nested into the top-level `styleOverrides` object now, as explained in the previous section.

```diff lang="js"
  /** @type {import('remark-expressive-code').RemarkExpressiveCodeOptions} */
  const remarkExpressiveCodeOptions = {
-   textMarkers: {
-     styleOverrides: {
-       markHue: '310',
-     },
-   },
+   styleOverrides: {
+     textMarkers: {
+       markHue: '310',
+     },
+     // You could override other plugin styles here as well:
+     // frames: { ... },
+   },
  },
```

### Rendering multiple themes no longer generates duplicate CSS and HTML output

In previous versions, a full set of CSS styles was generated for each individual theme, and each code block was rendered multiple times to include the HTML for each theme.

In this version, the CSS output has been changed to a single static set of base styles that uses CSS variables to allow efficient switching between themes.

Also, the HTML output for code blocks is now generated only once, and theme-dependent styles are applied using CSS variables.

These changes significantly reduce page size when using multiple themes, especially on pages with many code blocks.

If you have added CSS code to your site that relies on the old output (e.g. by selectively hiding or showing theme-specific code blocks based on their class name), you will need to update it to work with the new output.

> **Note**: Before writing new custom CSS, please consider if you can achieve your desired result out of the box now. For example, if your [`themes`](#themes) option contains one dark and one light theme, the [`useDarkModeMediaQuery`](#usedarkmodemediaquery) option will generate a `prefers-color-scheme` media query for you by default.

### Engine property `configClassName` has been removed

The `configClassName` property was previously used to add a config-dependent class name to the CSS selectors used to style code blocks.

As this property was automatically calculated by hashing the configuration object, it introduced a level of unpredictability, which has now been removed in favor of static base styles.

### Engine property `themeClassName` has been removed

The `themeClassName` property was previously used to add a theme-dependent class name to code blocks. Its format was `ec-theme-<name>`, where `<name>` was the kebab-cased name of the theme.

As code blocks are now styled using CSS variables instead of generating multiple blocks for all themes and attaching class names to them, this property is no longer needed.
