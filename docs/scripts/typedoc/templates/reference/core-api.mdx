## Code blocks

    #### Usage example

    ```js
    // codeBlockExample.js
    import { ExpressiveCodeBlock } from 'expressive-code'

    const codePlaintext = `
    // Perform very important calculations
    const a = 1 + 2
    `

    const codeBlock = new ExpressiveCodeBlock({
      code: codePlaintext.trim(),
      language: 'js',
    })

    // Delete the first line and output the remaining code
    codeBlock.deleteLine(0)
    console.dir(codeBlock.code)
    // --> 'const a = 1 + 2'
    ```

  append: |
    :::note
    You usually don't need to create code blocks manually. Instead, you can pass
    `ExpressiveCodeBlockOptions` to the `render` method of the `ExpressiveCodeEngine` class,
    and the engine will create the code blocks for you.

    Manually creating code blocks may still be useful in some cases, e.g. to allow
    integration authors to attach custom annotations to code blocks before passing them
    to the engine, or to attach custom data to a code block.

## Annotations

In Expressive Code, annotations are used by plugins to attach semantic information to lines or inline ranges of code. They are used to represent things like syntax highlighting, text markers, comments, errors, warnings, and other semantic information.

Annotations must provide a `render` function that transforms its contained AST nodes, e.g. by wrapping them in HTML tags. This function is called by the engine when it's time to render the line the annotation has been attached to.

````yml include
name: "ExpressiveCodeAnnotation"
headingLevel: 3
editSections:
- path: "Constructors"
  replaceWith: |
    :::note
    As an abstract class, `ExpressiveCodeAnnotation` cannot be instantiated directly.
    You should create a subclass that extends `ExpressiveCodeAnnotation` instead.
    :::
- path: "Properties"
  replaceWith: |
    All annotation base options are available on the instance as read-only properties.
    See [`AnnotationBaseOptions`](#annotationbaseoptions) for the entire list.

    #### Usage example

    In the following example, we create a plugin that makes the first word of each code block red in the first theme. We do this by adding an `InlineStyleAnnotation` to the first line of each code block.

    ```js
    // plugins/make-first-word-red.js
    import { InlineStyleAnnotation } from '@expressive-code/core'

    /** @returns {import('@expressive-code/core').ExpressiveCodePlugin} */
    export function pluginFirstWordRed() {
      return {
        name: 'Make first word red',
        hooks: {
          postprocessAnalyzedCode: (context) => {
            // Only apply this to code blocks with the `first-word-red` meta
            if (!context.codeBlock.meta.includes('first-word-red')) return

            // Get the first line of the code block
            const firstLine = context.codeBlock.getLine(0)
            if (!firstLine) return

            // Find the end of the first word
            const firstWordEnd = firstLine.text.match(/\W/)?.index
            if (!(firstWordEnd > 0)) return

            // Add an annotation that makes the first word red
            firstLine.addAnnotation(
              new InlineStyleAnnotation({
                inlineRange: {
                  columnStart: 0,
                  columnEnd: firstWordEnd,
                },
                color: '#ff0000',
                // Only apply the red color to the first configured theme
                styleVariantIndex: 0,
              })
            )
          },
        },
      }
    }
    ```

    After adding this plugin to your configuration, you can use it like this:

    ````
    ```js first-word-red
    consule.log('Hello world!')
    ```
    ````

    The rendered code block will now have a red text color applied to the first word, but only in the dark theme (the first theme in the configuration):

    ```js first-word-red
    consule.log('Hello world!')
    ```

    All config options that can be passed to the constructor are also available

    the entire list.
