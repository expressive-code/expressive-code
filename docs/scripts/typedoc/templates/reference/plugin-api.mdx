    ### Usage example

    ```ts
    // pluginDataExample.ts
    import { AttachedPluginData, ExpressiveCodePlugin } from '@expressive-code/core'

    export function pluginDataExample(): ExpressiveCodePlugin {
      return {
        name: 'AttachedPluginDataExample',
        hooks: {
          preprocessMetadata: ({ codeBlock }) => {
            // Get a reference to the block's data object
            const blockData = pluginFramesData.getOrCreateFor(codeBlock)

            // Example: Store the meta string in the data object
            // and remove it from the block
            blockData.extractedMeta = codeBlock.meta
            codeBlock.meta = ''
          },
          postprocessRenderedBlock: ({ codeBlock }) => {
            // Try to retrieve the stored title from the block's data object
            const blockData = pluginFramesData.getOrCreateFor(codeBlock)

            // Log the extracted data
            console.dir(blockData)
          },
        },
      }
    }

    // Define the data object type
    export interface PluginFramesData {
      extractedMeta?: string
    }

    // Create a singleton instance that allows attaching this type of data
    // to any object and to retrieve it later.
    // Note: Exporting is optional. This can be useful if multiple plugins
    //       need to work together.
    export const pluginFramesData = new AttachedPluginData<PluginFramesData>(
      // This function initializes the attached data
      // in case nothing was attached to an object yet
      () => ({})
    )
    ```

## Referenced types

````yml include
name: "AnnotationCommentHandler"
headingLevel: 3
editSections:
- path: ""
  append: |
    An object that you can add to the [`annotationCommentHandlers`](#annotationcommenthandlers) array property of an [`ExpressiveCodePlugin`](#expressivecodeplugin).

    A handler maps annotation tag names to settings that define how annotations using these tag names should be processed and rendered.

    Annotation comment handlers can be used to enrich the presentation of code blocks with additional information, such as highlights, notes, expected output, warnings, error messages, or links to external resources.

````yml include
name: "BaseStylesResolverFn"
headingLevel: 3
editSections:
- path: ""
  append: |
    A function that you can assign to the [`baseStyles`](#basestyles) property of an
    [`ExpressiveCodePlugin`](#expressivecodeplugin).

    The engine will call it when going through all registered plugins and collecting
    their base styles.

    :::tip
    You can use this to include CSS variables generated from any style settings,
    including your own [`PluginStyleSettings`](#pluginstylesettings), into your
    plugin's base styles.
    
    The function will be called with a `context` argument of type
    [`ResolverContext`](#resolvercontext) that provides helpful functions like
    `cssVar` to access any generated CSS variable by its style setting path.

headingLevel: 3

    their JS modules.
