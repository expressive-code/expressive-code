# Expressive Code

Expressive Code is an engine for presenting source code on the web, aiming to make your code easy to understand and visually stunning.

On top of accurate syntax highlighting powered by the same engine as VS Code, Expressive Code allows you to annotate code blocks using text markers, diff highlighting, code editor & terminal window frames, and more.

All annotations are based on a powerful plugin architecture that allows you to extend the functionality of Expressive Code with your own custom annotations.

Expressive Code doesn't depend on any client-side framework, is built with performance in mind and designed to be as lightweight as possible.

No matter if youâ€™re writing a blog, guide, or a full documentation website, Expressive Code will help you make your code examples stand out.
