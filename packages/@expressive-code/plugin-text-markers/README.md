# @expressive-code/plugin-text-markers

A default plugin of Expressive Code, an engine for presenting source code on the web.

It allows you to mark entire lines & line ranges, as well as individual text inside your lines using a selection of marker styles (marked, inserted, deleted).

It also ensures accessible color contrast of the marked code, automatically tweaking the text colors if necessary while keeping syntax highlighting intact.
