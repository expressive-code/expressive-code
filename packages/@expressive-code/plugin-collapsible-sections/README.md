# @expressive-code/plugin-collapsible-sections

An optional plugin for [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com/), an engine for presenting source code on the web.

It allows code sections to be marked as collapsed. The lines in collapsed sections will be hidden by default, replaced by a "X collapsed lines" line. When clicked, the collapsed section will be expanded, showing the previously hidden lines.
